Features
---
*   Request teleports via */tpa* or */tpahere*, and accept or deny them with */tpaccept* or */tpreject*
*   Moderators can use */tp* or */tphere*, which will ignore the request phase of a teleport
*   */tptoggle* will prevent users and moderators from teleporting to you, or requesting teleports from you
*   */tpo* and */tpohere* will override any user's */tptoggle* setting, and immediately teleport them
*   Teleport to a location with */tploc (x y z) (world)*, and don't be afraid of dying; the plugin will make sure the location is safe!
*   Each command has a permission node, and all messages reported to players are configurable. Total granularity.
